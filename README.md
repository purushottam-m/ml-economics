# Double debiased machine learning
It is based on the paper, Chernozhukov, V., Chetverikov, D., Demirer, M., Duflo, E., Hansen, C., Newey, W., & Robins, J. (2018). Double/debiased machine learning for treatment and structural parameters. I provide a generalized function to implement the double debiased machine learning using K-sample splits. The function k2ml in the file k2ml.R implements the same.
